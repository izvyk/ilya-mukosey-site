description: ['The project was awarded III place on the International Competition for Development of the Architectural and Artistic Concept of Moscow Metro Stations. The proposal refers to the architecture of the first line of the Moscow metro, viz. Ladovsky. At the same time, we are deeply convinced that such a color solution is the best way to display all the visual advantages of the pylon construction stations. At the station itself, the alternation of red and white colors reveals the spatial correlation of the three cylinders - the tunnels, celebrates the ratio of voids and solid elements in them. In the entrance halls and transition passages the color scheme emphasizes the priority directions of the passengers flow.', 
'Basic finishing materials for the floor and walls are red and white marble with a matte surface. The choice of materials refers not only to Soviet architecture, but also to the modern metro construction practice. White sections of the ceiling at the underground station and passages are executed in plaster and paint. Polished stainless steel is used to design a «jumper» between different elements of the station. Local interventions of this material mark the transition from one zone of the station to another. Along the way up to the street materials change. The ceiling of the escalator gallery is painted in two shades of white - matte and glossy.', 
'In the upper level entrance foyer walls and floor are covered with stone, while the ceiling is carried out differently. Dark sections - red copper panels, light areas - a white lattice «grigliato» with hidden illumination. In the entrance passage area marble on the floor is replaced by granite.',
'The entrance pavilion is completely lined with metal: light grey embossed grey aluminium panels for walls and red copper panels for ceiling.',
'The lower-level spaces are almost completely lit by the reflected light. This solution is quite traditional both for Soviet and current periods of the Moscow Metro construction. The edges of the platforms are provided with the additional linear suspended lighting.',
'Built-in ceiling lamps with a matte diffuser are used in areas with the lowered ceiling, such as passageways from the main station space to the platforms. Vertical torch-like cilindrical lamps are used on the escalators.',
'Grouped linear lighting hidden behind the «grigliato» ceiling is used in the upper-level area (box-office hall and exit).']
